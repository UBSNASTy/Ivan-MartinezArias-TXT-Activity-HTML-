        A couple hobbies I enjoy doing in my free time:
</p><p>
Video Games: Most of the times, I enjoy playing video games whenever I have the time! I play a variety of games and consoles, ranging from Playstation to Nintendo to Xbox, and many more. Some of my favorite game series would be Mother, Tonky Hawk, Persona, Danganronpa, Borderlands, Mario Party, Smash Bros, and a few more.

<p>
Hiking: My campus allows me to hike anywhere due to how many trails there are in this campus. With that, the scenery is amazing and beautiful, depending where you decide to hike. The campus provides a location where you can explore around and find new, interesting things. I love the scenery that my campus hiking provides, so I try to take advantage of it whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
Skateboarding: I enjoy skateboarding and longboarding as it is very relaxing to me. I usually like street skating for skateboarding and just pure longboarding for the relaxing cruises. While I know how most tricks are regarding skateboarding, I'm still an amateur due to not owning a board but I will soon in the near future.
